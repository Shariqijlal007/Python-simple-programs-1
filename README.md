# Python-simple-programs
Here are some simple programs that i've wrote when i was Practicing Python.
Enjoy!!!








1. A program that requests the user to enter the current world population and the current population of the U.S. (or of some other nation of your choice). Store the information in variables of type int. Have the program display the percent that the U.S. (or other nation’s) population is of the world’s population. The output should look something like this: 
Enter the world's population: 6888 
Enter the population of the US: 310 
The population of the US is 4.5% of the world population.
2. A program that asks how many miles you have driven and how many gallons of gasoline you have used and then reports the miles per gallon your car has gotten. The program can request distance in kilometers and petrol in liters and then report the result in liters per 100 kilometers.
3. A python program which will compute the area of a square (area=𝒔𝒊𝒅𝒆^𝟐) or a triangle (area = (𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞∗𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭)/𝟐) after prompting the user to type the first character of the figure name (t or s).
4. A python code that prompts the user to input three integer values and find the greatest value of the three values.
